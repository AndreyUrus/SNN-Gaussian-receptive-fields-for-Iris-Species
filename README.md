# SNN-Gaussian-receptive-fields-for-Iris-Species
I propose an original solution to one of the most well-known machine learning problems - Iris Species using a spiking neural network (SNN), with a test accuracy of 100%. In my work, I will not use well-known ready-made solutions in python related to SNN. All the code is written by me from scratch, using only NumPy and Pandas.
